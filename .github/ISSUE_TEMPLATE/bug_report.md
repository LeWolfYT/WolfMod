**NOTE**:
* Before reporting an issue, please make sure it has not already been fixed in a later version! Also make sure you have the latest version of the mod! The very latest development versions are available here: https://sidplayz.glitch.me/mods/wolfmod/releases so you can quickly check if you have the latest builds. The versions on CurseForge are not usually the very latest builds, but important bug fixes will also be uploaded there.
* Please don't post simple questions like "How do I do X?" on this issue tracker. Such help requests should happen on Discord instead: https://discord.gg/CwDgFm8E in #wolfmod-help
